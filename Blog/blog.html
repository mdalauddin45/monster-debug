        <h2>Q.2 Difference Between global scope and block scope</h2>
        <h4 class="text-danger

        ">Global Scope</h4>
        <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global
            scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
            conditional state can access that variable.</p>
        <h4 class="text-danger

        ">Block Scope</h4>
        <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
            something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

        <h2>Q.3 how to work javaScript eventLoop</h2>
        <p>
            The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

        <h2>Q.4 how many undefined in javaScript</h2>
        <p>
            undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value
            of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
            <br>
            <br>
            In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not
            the case, avoid overriding it.)
            <br>
            <br>
            A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
            undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
            undefined if a value was not returned.
        </p>
